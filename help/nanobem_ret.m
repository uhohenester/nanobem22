%% Solver for full Maxwell's equations 
%
% These classes allow to perform Galerkin BEM simulations of the full
% Maxwell's equation.  We use boundary elements together with
% Raviart-Thomas shape elementes, a class for the computation of the
% Calderon matrix and the solution of the BEM equation, as well as
% simulation classes for planewave and dipole excitation.
