%% Solver for quasistatic Maxwell's equations 
%
% These classes allow to perform Galerkin BEM simulations of Maxwell's
% equation within the quasistatic approximation.  We use boundary elements
% together with linear shape elementes, a class for the computation of the
% Green functions and the solution of the quasisttaic BEM equation, as well
% as simulation classes for planewave and dipole excitation.
